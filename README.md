*THIS PROJECT IS STILL ON PROGRESS!!*

Since we are still working on it, currently only the "FERRARI" show page is accessible under 'All Brands' section. So, right now, you
can access only the Ferrari page. WE WILL ADD MORE SOON!

What does it have?
-Own API created for handling the JSON data.
-MongoDB for Database.
-Bootstrap.
-AJAX and promises for single-page data handling.
-NodeJS for handling server side routing

*CURRENTLY, WE ARE WORKING ON THE AUTHENTICATION PART AS WELL.
